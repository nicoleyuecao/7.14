      With the development of science, we receive information all the time. Some people think that information is reliable, it helps people to work easily. Others believe that the information is not credible because it contains an incorrect message. I agree with the second opinion, because there is a growing information trap, which causes people to lose money or personal information.

      People cannot live in a society without information because infomation benefits people with their homework, and survey. For example, we are given paper work by teacher and was asked for collect our country’s history development data in a year or when we move to a new place and want to buy commodity consumption , but we donnot know the way to a supermarket. In those situation, the information is real, and helps people to find a way to their destination.

      People get fake information around them. A job is one of the most decisive things in our life. However, we might get some troubles because of those things. For instance, when we are surfing the internet, we received invited advitised on the screen and most of advitised is used to cheat their money instead of really want to invite people. In this situation, the information is unreliable, because it did not have the function as the advertised stated.
    Information is a double-edged sword. It contains pros and cons , and it all depends on people how to use it. let’s looking forward to the healthy process of information and make good use of it.
